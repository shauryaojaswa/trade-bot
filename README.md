# Trading Bot Application

This application simulates a basic trading bot for a hypothetical stock market using Node.js.

## Trading Logic

The bot uses a simple price change strategy:
- Buy when the stock price drops by 2% (configurable)
- Sell when the stock price rises by 3% (configurable)

## API Usage

Added a mockGetStockPrice function that generates random stock prices around a base price of $100 with some volatility.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
2. run node trading-bot.js
